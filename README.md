PayPal Here&trade; Sideloader API
==================

This project contains 3 very lightweight samples for Android, iOS & Web that show how PayPal Here&trade; can be integrated into your own projects using the Sideloader API.
___
Basically you need an Android or iOS phone/tablet with our PayPal Here&trade; app installed. To accept payments using PayPal Here&trade; you need a valid PayPal merchant account that is registered for PayPal Here&trade; in the supported countries.

The Sideloader API uses an url scheme to communicate with the PayPal Here app and retrieves the payment's result via a callback mechanism.
